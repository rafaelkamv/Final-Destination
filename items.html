## How add a new Custom Texture

First, download the Texturepack, after that Unzips the Zip file, now after you done that navigate through assets/minecraft/optifine/cit

now you can choose what texture you want to make, if its an items go to items and same for armor.

in this i will show you how to make a Custom Item texture because for armor is a little bit more complicated.

so after you navigate through the /optifine/cit/items you can weapons, tools, and accessories, depends on your Custom Texture it will be put in one of those three.


Now Texturing, i recommend [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download) its free and easy to use.

this Texturepack is in 16x which is its 16x16 Pixels, so what you want to do is open paint.net then press Ctrl + N it will show you the "New" Gui

In there type the pixel size:

   Width: 16
   
   Height: 16

The resolution should follow over automatically.

After that you can make any texture you want, Pickaxe, Axe, Sword, Bow, etc.
